Why is Singapore Airlines folding fuel and insurance surcharges into base airfares?
Since 2008, we have already been showing the full price payable, inclusive of taxes and surcharges in our airfare advertising. The intention of removing fuel and insurance surcharges as a separate component and incorporating them into a single base airfare is to provide you with a more simplified fare structure. Taxes and charges levied by airport/government authorities will continue to be listed separately on your ticket.
From which date onwards will I no longer see a separate fuel and insurance surcharge component for my ticket purchases?
The folding in of fuel and insurance surcharges into the base airfares on Singapore Airlines flights will take place progressively from 28 March 2017.
How will I know if fuel and insurance surcharges are still charged as a separate component in my Singapore Airlines ticket?
Fuel and insurance surcharges are denoted by the “YQ” code, as reflected in the “Payment Details” section of your e-ticket. Once the fuel and insurance surcharges have been incorporated into the base airfare, the e-ticket receipt will either: (i) Not include the “YQ” tax code under “Taxes”, OR (ii) ”$0.00” will be shown beside the “YQ” code. If you are purchasing your tickets via singaporeair.com or silkair.com, you will no longer see “Airline Insurance (YQAD)” and “Airline Fuel Surcharge (YQAC)” listed under the cost breakdown for airport and government taxes.
How does this folding-in affect the ticket prices that I will be paying?
There will be no immediate change to the total airfare payable as a direct consequence from the folding in of fuel and insurance surcharges into a single base airfare when you purchase your tickets with us. Taxes and charges levied by airport/government authorities will continue to be listed separately on your ticket. Any change to the all-in fares would be due solely to seasonal review in pricing, based on prevailing market supply and demand conditions, and fluctuation in currency exchange rates.
My travel itinerary involves flights on other airlines. Will I still be charged fuel and insurance surcharge?
If your travel itinerary involve other airlines’ flights, fuel and insurance surcharges may still be applicable. The folding in of fuel and insurance surcharges into base airfares apply only for Singapore Airlines flights.
Will fuel and insurance surcharges apply on Singapore Airlines codeshare flights operated by other airlines?
For flights where Singapore Airlines is the marketing carrier, fuel and insurance surcharges may still be applicable.
Why am I still seeing fuel and insurance surcharge as a separate component on my e-ticket receipts?
It could be due to one of the following reasons: (i) Your travel itinerary include other airlines’ flight numbers, where fuel and/or insurance surcharge may still be applicable depending on other airlines’ policy; or (ii) Your ticket was partially flown/utilised and was re-issued, from an original ticket which had fuel and insurance surcharges (“YQ”) listed as a separate component from the base airfare; or (iii) Your ticket was issued/re-issued before the cutover date.
Can I ask for a refund of the fuel and insurance surcharges that I have paid?
There is no change in the total airfare payable, as a result of the folding in of fuel and insurance surcharges in the base airfare. We do not refund the base airfare or the fuel surcharges separately from each other. If you would like to refund your entire ticket, it would be subjected to eligibility conditions and applicable fees.
The ticket I purchased has fuel and insurance surcharges listed as a separate component of the base airfare. If I need to make changes to my itinerary, will I still be charged fuel and insurance surcharges?
If you have not flown on any of the travel sectors on your ticket itinerary and would like to make changes to your itinerary, fuel and insurance surcharges will no longer reflect as a separate component of your air ticket. You will however see a higher base airfare on your new ticket as the surcharges are now folded in. If you have travelled on at least one travel sector in your ticket itinerary, fuel and insurance surcharges will continue to reflect as a separate component and will not be folded into the base airfares for your new ticket.

Why was my China-issued Visa card declined for transactions made in the Chinese Yuan?
Chinese Yuan (CNY) transactions paid with Visa cards issued in mainland China will be automatically declined due to local regulations. We recommend paying with UnionPay, Alipay, Mastercard or American Express instead.
Why must I present my credit / debit card for verification before departure?
When you make a booking with a credit / debit card, your booking undergoes verification by our fraud detection tools. The tools use several types of information, such as the time to departure, your point of departure and destinations, for verification. Then, an algorithm determines the risk level of your payment transaction. If the risk level of your booking is found to be high, you may be required to verify your credit / debit card in person, as well as to provide photo identification. This verification process protects you against credit / debit card fraud and ensures your security when making credit / debit card payments.
I’ve booked a flight for someone else and paid with my credit / debit card. Can the passenger present the credit / debit card for verification on my behalf?
No, for security, the cardholder must  present their credit / debit card in person for verification. If you’re unable to do this, get in touch with your local Singapore Airlines office here https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/contact-us/.
Are my credit / debit card details secure?
All credit / debit card transactions are processed through our fraud detection system and bank authentication programmes. Transactions that are not secure will be automatically denied. All our payment processors are fully compliant with international PCI DSS security standards to ensure payment security, privacy and proper data handling.
Can I change my payment method?
No, the payment method cannot be changed once your payment has been processed. But you may use different payment methods to change your booking or to purchase add-ons at our Manage Booking page.
Why was my transaction declined?
All transactions are subject to the approval of your issuing bank / payment provider. If your transaction was denied by your issuing bank, we won't be able to process your payment. Contact your issuing bank for information about why your transaction was declined. We are unable to contact your issuing bank on your behalf due to customer privacy policies. If your card has 3D-Secure, you must authenticate your transaction to complete payment. Your transaction will be declined if authentication fails.
How do I prevent my transaction from being declined?
For a successful transaction with your credit / debit card: Ensure that you have sufficient credit or balance. Ensure that your payment details have been correctly entered. Ensure that your credit / debit card has not been reported stolen or used for fraudulent activity. Ensure that the country of the issuing bank does not have currency or credit limitations. Ensure that e-commerce transactions have been enabled for your credit / debit card. For Alternative Payment Methods (APMs), ensure that your log-in credentials have been entered correctly. For Alternative Payment Methods (APMs), ensure that your account has sufficient balance
Why is the website stuck at the loading page?
This may be due to intermittent connectivity issues which are preventing us from getting a timely response from your issuing bank. This may ultimately result in a time-out. If this happens to you, don't close your browser or tab while the page is loading. Instead, contact your local Singapore Airlines office here https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/contact-us/ for assistance.
I encountered an error after making payment, but my credit card has been deducted.
Unfortunately, we encountered an issue when issuing your ticket, and your payment has been put on hold. Don't worry. In such cases, a request is usually sent immediately to your issuing bank to reverse the payment, and you should see this reversal in your statement in about 5 – 10 working days. You may speak to your issuing bank to learn more about the status of your transaction. If the held amount is not released after 10 working days, get in touch with your local Singapore Airlines office here https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/contact-us/.
Why was I not shown my bank's 3D-Secure authentication page?
Your card will have to be enrolled in your issuing bank's 3D-Secure programme for a 3D-Secure page to be shown during payment. If your card is enrolled but you were not directed to a 3D-Secure page, this may be an error due to intermittent connectivity issues with your issuing bank's servers. In this case, your payment will still be processed as usual without the authentication step.
What are the Verified by Visa and Mastercard SecureCode programmes?
These programmes prevent unauthorised use of your Visa see https://usa.visa.com/products/visa-secure.html and Mastercard see https://www.mastercard.us/en-us.html credit / debit cards by requiring that you enter a unique password every time you make an online payment.
How will I earn PPS Value?
When you fly in Singapore Airlines’ Suites, First or Business Class, you earn PPS Value, which goes towards your PPS Club status. PPS Value is based on your airfare and fuel surcharge*, but not airport taxes. It’s calculated in Singapore dollars, so if you’ve bought your ticket in another currency, the airfare and fuel surcharge* portions are converted to Singapore dollars to determine your PPS Value.
Why are taxes and fees not included in the PPS Value I earn?
Airport taxes and other fees are paid directly to government agencies and not to us. Therefore, we’re unable to credit PPS Value to you on these charges.
Will PPS Value be credited for itineraries that include flights operated by partner airlines?
No. PPS Value will only be credited for flights operated by Singapore Airlines and not for flights operated by our partner airlines. For instance, if you’re flying from Singapore to Munich via Frankfurt, you’ll receive PPS Value for the flight from Singapore to Frankfurt as you’ll be flying on a Singapore Airlines aircraft. From Frankfurt to Munich, you’ll fly on the aircraft of our partner airline, Lufthansa, so you won’t earn PPS Value.
Will PPS Value be credited for codeshare flights?
Yes. If you fly in First or Business Class on a codeshare flight, you’ll earn PPS Value if your journey’s on a Singapore Airlines aircraft.
On some flights, why can’t I get the seat indicated in my preferences?
Your seat preference is stored on your profile for your convenience, so that it can be pre-selected for you whenever you make a booking with us. However, seats are allocated on a first-come-first-served basis – so if your seat is no longer available when you make your booking, another seat will be given to you.
Can Reserve Value be extended?
No it cannot be extended. To maximise the validity of your Reserve Value, your membership will always be renewed using your Reserve Value before adding the PPS Value you’ve earned in your current membership year.
Do Solitaire PPS Club Supplementary cardholders have the same benefits as Solitaire PPS Club members?
No. Solitaire PPS Club Supplementary cardholders enjoy many, but not all, of the privileges of Solitaire PPS Club membership. To find out more about Solitaire PPS Club Supplementary cardholders privileges, see https://www.singaporeair.com/pdf/ppsclub_krisflyer/charts/SolitairePPS_SuppCard_Oct15.pdf. When it comes to earning of PPS Value as well as KrisFlyer and Elite miles, Solitaire PPS Club Supplementary cardholders will have them credited to the account that corresponds with their own membership status within the KrisFlyer or PPS Club programme.
Will a Solitaire PPS Club Supplementary cardholder also have Reserve Value?
Only PPS Club and Solitaire PPS Club members can have Reserve Value. If your Supplementary Solitaire PPS Club cardholder is also a PPS Club or Solitaire PPS Club member, the Reserve Value he/she has will be credited to his/her account.
Can Solitaire PPS Club Life members earn Reserve Value?
No, because they don’t need Reserve Value. Solitaire PPS Club Life members can enjoy their status without having to renew their membership.
What if my PPS Club membership is not renewed?
f the Reserve Value you have, together with the PPS Value you earned by the end of your current membership year, is less than 25,000, your PPS Club membership will not be renewed. 
Why is the expiry date on my PPS Club membership card different from the membership expiry date stated when I log in online?
As a PPS Club member, your membership year lasts until the end of the 12th month from the date of your upgrade or renewal. For your convenience, your membership card is valid for an extra month after the end of your membership year so that you can continue to enjoy the benefits of your status as you wait for the delivery of your new membership card. However, if your membership status is upgraded or not renewed, the benefits of the new tier will take effect from the start of your new membership year – and not after the expiry date on your membership card.
How can I claim missing PPS Value?
The same way you claim missing miles – log in here https://www.singaporeair.com/kfLogin.form and enter your full name, flight number and destination. You’ll normally see your PPS Value between two and four weeks after your flight.

What is Two-factor authentication/2FA?
Two-factor authentication is an additional measure introduced to enhance the security of your KrisFlyer account. A time-sensitive randomly generated password, also known as a One-Time Password (OTP) will be sent to you, for identified KrisFlyer transactions (e.g. when you access your KrisFlyer profile or make changes to your redemption group nominees). As a default, the OTP will be sent to your registered mobile number to validate your identity. Should a mobile number not be available, the OTP will be sent to your registered email address. As such please ensure that the mobile number and email address indicated in your KrisFlyer profile belongs to you, is up-to-date, and actively used. Download the following guide https://www.singaporeair.com/saar5/pdf/ppsclub_krisflyer/guides/Entering-your-OTP.pdf for more details.
Why did Singapore Airlines introduce 2FA?
Singapore Airlines is committed to providing our customers with a high level of online security. 2FA has been introduced as part of KrisFlyer’s ongoing efforts to enhance online security for the benefit of our members. 2FA relies on: Information you know (that is your KrisFlyer membership no. and account Password). Information SIA provides to you (One-time Password).
When will 2FA be used?
2FA will be required when you perform identified KrisFlyer transactions online. These include: Accessing and editing your KrisFlyer Profile. Adding/removing redemption group nominees in the booking flow. Adding/linking new redemption partners to convert miles to other loyalty programs (Fliggy, Shangri-La, Velocity, Esso, CapitaStar). Resetting your account password under “Need Help Logging In” in the KrisFlyer account login widget. Conversion of KrisFlyer miles to partner points (namely Fliggy, Shangri-La, Velocity, Esso, CapitaStar, Link Rewards). Donation of KrisFlyer miles. Accessing partner websites such as FlyScoot.com, KrisShop.com, KrisFlyervRooms.com and Pelago.co when you are logged in to KrisFlyer account.

How do I update my contact details?
You can follow these steps to update your contact details: Log in to your KrisFlyer account. Click on the “Profile” tab. Click on the “Edit” button beside “Personal Details”. Your mobile number and email address can be edited under the “Contact Details” section. Click “Save”. Please note that you will be prompted for 2FA under step 2 after 2FA implementation on 29 June 2018.
What should I do if my mobile number and/or email address are not updated after 2FA implementation?
If your mobile number is not updated, request to receive your OTP via email in order to access your KrisFlyer profile to make the change. If both your mobile number and email address are not updated, contact KrisFlyer Membership Services here https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/contact-us/ to update your contact details.
Can I use or share a common mobile number or email address to receive the OTP?
We strongly encourage you to maintain individual mobile number and unique email address for your KrisFlyer account since key notifications and sensitive information pertaining to your account are sent to the mobile number and/or email address recorded in your KrisFlyer profile.  
Must I provide my mobile number? Is email address sufficient? What if I don’t have a mobile number?
Mobile number is mandatory for your KrisFlyer account as it is a more secure platform to receive the OTP. In scenarios where you are unable to access your mobile phone or receive OTP by SMS, you may request to receive the OTP via your email. If you do not have a mobile number in your profile when 2FA is rolled out, you will be allowed to receive your OTP via email to update your mobile number before you log out.
Will my KrisFlyer account be locked if I enter the OTP wrongly?
No, your KrisFlyer account will not be locked. However, you will not be able to perform certain transactions. KrisFlyer accounts will be locked at login only if the wrong KrisFlyer account number and/or account password is entered after consecutive tries.
Can I use the OTP service overseas?
As the OTP is always sent as a default to your mobile number saved in your KrisFlyer profile, the foreign country would need to support GSM network and SMS. Please contact your mobile service operator for further details on receiving SMS sent from Singapore whilst overseas.  
What if my overseas mobile service operator or the country I am in does not support GSM network or SMS technology? What happens if I’m overseas with no access to data roaming?
If you are travelling, you are encouraged to make all your KrisFlyer transactions before leaving. In scenarios where you are unable to access your mobile phone or receive OTP via SMS or experience a lag in receiving SMS, kindly request to receive the OTP via your email address indicated in your KrisFlyer profile.
How long do I have to wait before an OTP is sent to me?
OTP is sent to your mobile number instantly and is normally received within seconds. In cases where you are experiencing weak mobile connection, there might be a short delay.
I requested for OTP by SMS but did not receive it. What should I do?
If you did not receive your OTP within 2 minutes, select “Resend OTP” to request a new OTP. Note that there may be a lag time in receiving OTP via SMS if there’s a weak mobile connection. Alternatively, you can request for OTP to be sent to your email address. Please verify that the mobile number in your KrisFlyer profile is updated.
I did not receive my OTP after multiple resends despite having the correct mobile number and email address in my records. What should I do?
There may be a lag time in receiving OTP via SMS if there’s a weak mobile connection. If you requested for OTP via email, check the spam folder in your email account for the OTP email.

These checks include: At least one KrisFlyer miles accrual from a flight* in the last 36 months and no KrisFlyer miles accrual from credit card transfers or co-brand card spends in the last 36 months. After the initial 24-hour period has passed and the child’s account fulfils the checks mentioned above, you will be able to transfer KrisFlyer miles from your child’s account to your account, subject to a cap of 50,000 KrisFlyer miles per calendar year to be transferred out of any child’s account.

If the 500 miles option is selected, the service fee will be net off from the amount of KrisFlyer miles to be transferred.
What are the benefits of linking my child’s KrisFlyer account to mine?
Linking your KrisFlyer accounts will allow you to transfer KrisFlyer miles from your child’s account to yours, enabling you to redeem your pooled miles for rewards much quicker than before.
